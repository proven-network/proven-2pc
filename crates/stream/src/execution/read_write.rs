//! Read-write execution path with full 2PC support
//!
//! This module handles the complex logic of read-write transactions that was
//! previously embedded in the processor. It's designed to be called from the
//! processor but needs access to processor state for transaction tracking,
//! wound-wait management, and deferred operations.

/// Execute a read-write transaction with full 2PC support
///
/// Note: This is currently a passthrough to the processor's existing logic
/// because read-write transactions need access to:
/// - Transaction coordinator tracking
/// - Wounded transaction state
/// - Transaction deadlines
/// - Deferred operations manager
/// - Recovery manager
///
/// A future refactoring could move all this state into a TransactionContext
/// that gets passed to this function, but for now the processor handles it.
